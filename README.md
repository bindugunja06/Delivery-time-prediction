# Delivery Time Prediction 🚚
This project aims to predict delivery time using real-world data from food delivery services. The goal is to help logistics teams better estimate delivery duration based on factors like restaurant location, distance, delivery person ratings, and traffic conditions.
## 📊 Problem Statement
Accurately predicting delivery time improves customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project uses a machine learning regression model to forecast delivery time based on historical data.
## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Performed EDA and data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers
- Engineered relevant features from location and rating data
- Built and compared multiple regression models
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R²
## 📁 Project Structure
- `delivery_time_prediction.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, EDA, modeling, and results
- `README.md`: Project overview and summary
## 🚀 Outcome
Achieved a reasonably accurate model for predicting delivery time, with key insights on which features impact delivery delays.
